	<h1> Chapter 1 - 1 </h1>

		If there is one thing that I would like to capture by hosting this project, it is the idea that film is a rich language with many different threads that run their course throughout its history. 
		Think about all the musical movements that sprout further musical movements and the threads that link Bach to Stravinsky to Rick James.
		Filmmakers are always paying tribute to their predecessors, making references to them and re-appropriating their techniques. 
		In some ways you could argue the photographic image itself is a tribute to the past!<br>
		<br>
		In this chapter we will be introducing some of the precursors of film, leading up to the first 'movie' experience.
		As you can see, people have been fascinated with the idea of producing the illusion of movement for quite some time! 
		In many ways, movement is arguably the essence of film, the element that separates it from the artforms that came before it. 
		You are always looking at a rapid succession of images flying by your eye when watching film even if the 'image' is still. <br>
		<br>
		Take a look at this video introducing some of these really cool technologies that preceded film! <br>

		The zoetrope in particular gets referenced quite often as a symbol of this spirit that motivated the invention of the moving picture film. 
		Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas named their first studio, Zoetrope Studios (later becoming American Zoetrope).<br>
		It also gets referenced in The 400 Blows by Truffaut. His films often depict people playing with image related technology, one of the many serious fascinations of the artists of the French New Wave.<br>
		<br>
		Here is a clip from The 400 Blows with the reference to the zoetrope:<br>

		Chungking Express features a technique called Step Printing, which is a process that involves shooting at a lower framerate, 
		then duplicating or tripling the frames, and playing them at a normal framerate so that images give the impression that they are lingering. <br>
