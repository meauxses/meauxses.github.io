	<h1> Chapter 1 - 3</h1>

		This section will cover a few of the earliest “feature” films.<br>
		<br>
		Georges Melies was a French stage illusionist who attended one of the first exhibitions by the Lumieres brothers. 
		He was so enamored with the device that he offered to purchase one of their machines on the spot. 
		Although he was denied, Melies was very resourceful in finding other work-arounds to rig his own film camera, using technology that he purchased from the Edison company.<br>
		<br>
		Melies is credited with inventing some of the earliest film editing techniques. According to his memoirs, he came up with the “stop-trick” on accident, 
		a technique where a figure existing in one frame is either disappeared or replaced with a different figure in the next frame. 
		Quite easy to take for granted but these were the earliest “special effects”. He also implemented double exposure to superimpose images by rewinding footage and recording over them, 
		and was even able to reproduce images of himself on film playing different instruments.<br>
		<br>
		In his films you can also see other aspects of his theater experience, such as the incredible set designs and costumes he incorporated.<br>
		<br>
		This rendition of “A Trip to the Moon” or “Voyages dans la lune” is a hand-painted version. He also sold black and white copies to people in the U.S. and gained international fame with this film.
		 Unfortunately Melies' career saw a great decline, partially due to Thomas Edison's growing monopoly and patenting within the film industry in the U.S., 
		 so his stature within film history really only developed after his lifetime.<br>

		With “The Great Train Robbery” we have the first American Western film, a genre explored with great enthusiasm by future directors. 
		Edwin S. Porter was a film technician who worked for the Edison Studios and was both greatly influenced by and in direct competition with Georges Melies
		 in creating entertaining uses for the film form. “The Great Train Robbery” is his most famous film, 
		 and it is credited with some of the earliest uses of shooting on location as well as film editing to show simultaneous action between cuts. 
		 The last “shot” is quite infamous for depicting a man breaking the fourth wall and aiming a gun at the audience presumably watching the film.<br>
		 <br>
		 “A Trip to the Moon” is fun to compare to “The Great Train Robbery” for a lot of different reasons but I especially love how they highlight a lot of later film philosophies.
		 With Melies, you can see how his emphasis on set design, costuming, fantasy, and overall mise-en-scene would be quite an influence on German Expressionist film 
		 that would come a decade or two after it. With Porter's film you can see how shooting on location is a precursor to movements such as cinema verite, italian neorealism, or even dogme 95. 
		 And of course, it is REALLY interesting how these film makers instinctively understood that they could convey narrative and the passage of time through cuts, 
		 something that we may examine further in soviet montage theory later on.<br>

		 ^Here is the last shot of Goodfellas which also has a character looking directly and shooting his gun at the audience. Timestamped 2 min 15 secs<br>
		 <br>
		 It's important to know that film was still largely delegated to the realm of curious attraction during this period as there were no dedicated avenues to display them yet. 
		 Projectionist systems were often traveling acts. <br>
