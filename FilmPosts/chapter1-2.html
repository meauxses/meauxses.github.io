	<h1> Chapter 1 - 2</h1>

		Fast forward to the 1890s and we arrive at the Lumiere brothers' invention of the 'cinematograph', a technology that was part camera, part projector, and was an advancement of the kinetoscope invented by Thomas Edison. Now multiple people could view films at the same time! The Lumiere brothers are important not for having invented the first moving image, but for popularizing and sensationalizing the moving image to audiences. Ironically, Thomas Edison would reappropriate some of their inventions in his own films in the U.S. In fact much of the early stages of film technology involves people copying and patenting other peoples' work, keeping with the predatory spirit of capitalism in the Industrial Revolution. Film is in some ways inseparable from its industry in a manner quite distinct from many artforms before it.<br>
		<br>
		When viewing the very first films, keep in mind:<br>
		'What were people choosing to depict in the camera?'<br>
		'What rules of cinema do they seem to be following/establishing?'<br>
		'What aspects of the moving image would be most fascinating or shocking to audiences?'<br>

		Apparently, when audiences first saw Arrival of a Train... they panicked because they believed it was coming toward them. 
		They gasped and ran away from it and flipped over chairs. The train, as with the zoetrope mentioned before, 
		also gets referenced quite often as a cinematic symbol. In part, this is because of the profound impact that this Lumere brothers' film 
		had on audiences.<br>
		<br>
		You might consider it a stretch that a film such as Inception could be drawing on something as old as the first silent films. 
		Yet, Inception thematically has so much to do with sensations that seem real but are not (dreams vs reality), a direct preoccupation of film from birth!<br>
		<br>
		Here are some films that play with this reference (Inception, The Spirit of the Beehive, Pierrot le Fou):<br>

		It's also interesting to note that not long after it was invented, film immediately became a vehicle for pornography. People seemed to want to capture violence (like the electrocution of the elephant) and sex even in the early stages of film technology! You can see we are still very preoccupied with depicting those things today.<br>
